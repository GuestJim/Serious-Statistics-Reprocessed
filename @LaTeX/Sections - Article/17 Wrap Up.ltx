\section{Wrap Up}
I started working on this article to satisfy a few purposes.
One was to provide descriptions and explanations for the statistics and graphs I use in reviews, performance analyses, and other articles, so I do not always feel the need or desire to explain the otherwise unremarkable objects.
Another was to share and document the scripts I have developed for doing this process and generating the graphs.
Perhaps there is someone curious about my specific methods, and as I taught myself how to make these scripts by searching online and reading documentation, it seems appropriate to invest my time to increase the information to others doing the same.
Sadly they may have to read much more than they (or I) may want to for a solution to some problem. 
And finally, it gave me a good reason to go through the statistics, graphs, and scripts all at once.
Typically the changes I have made to them come about as I have a specific idea for a specific situation and are implemented in a specific place.
By essentially auditing all of the code, I have fixed issues I had not run into before, improved modularity to make future additions easier, and increased functionality by taking advantage of tools I used in one place, but had not yet adapted to others.

I know I have and will benefit from the work I have done and I hope some of you reading this will also find some benefit in it as well.
