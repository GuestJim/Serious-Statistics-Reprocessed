# Serious-Statistics-Reprocessed
The source files and LaTeX for the Serious Statistics Reprocessed: Statistics and Scripts article.
This article covers the various statistics, graphs, and scripts I use in reviews, performance analyses, and miscellaneous articles so anyone curious can learn more about them.
Just the scripts can be found in this repository, which should also be always up-to-date:

The 'meanGEO stuff.r' file was always run by hand, after supplying the Input script and part of the Output script. It is also not as cleanly built as the other scripts, as it was really just meant to get the job done.

2020-06-20 Update:
Following a new overhaul to the scripts, I have revised this article, integrating these changes and making other corrections.
I did neglect to touch the "meanGEO stuff.r" script and outputs. It is an oversight but it should still work as no changes I made should disrupt it.

Due to the significance of this update, the 1.x branch has been made to stand as an archive of the older versions.

2019-11-05 Update:

I have constructed and added a presentation based on the article.
Its source files have been added to the repository and there is a handout version as well.

To make some of the graphs for the Presentation, I manually removed (commented out) ggplot2 layers and renamed the files, but did not then save the changes to the script.
