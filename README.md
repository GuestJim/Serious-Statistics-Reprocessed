# Serious-Statistics-Reprocessed
The source files and LaTeX for the Serious Statistics Reprocessed: Statistics and Scripts article.
This article covers the various statistics, graphs, and scripts I use in reviews, performance analyses, and miscellaneous articles so anyone curious can learn more about them.
Just the scripts can be found in this repository, which should also be always up-to-date:

Due to the large size of the Combined CSV file, it is compressed, so you will need to unzip it. It is 311 MB unzipped and 30.2 MB zipped.

The 'meanGEO stuff.r' file was always run by hand, after supplying the Input script and part of the Output script. It is also not as cleanly built as the other scripts, as it was really just meant to get the job done.
